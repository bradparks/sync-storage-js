### Sync Storage JS ###

This library provides support for synchronizing several databases together. Databases can be either local (in the browser) or remote.

Main features provided :
* easy synchronization
* asynchronous interface
* indexing and fast querying
* simple querying

Features to come :
* support for remote CouchDB
* support for remote MongoDB on MongoLabs

What SyncDB does not and will not provide :
* an abstraction layer to use a local database. Please use other library like localForage or jStorage.


Development is still on early stage. Stay tuned.
